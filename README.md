# Genshin Tracker

Yup, not the best name.<br>
This is my custom genshin tracker, so I just update it as I need.

## Genshin data

The application full data is in a JSON which I update/extract based on [Fandom](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) data.<br>
So there must be a lot of (copy-paste) errors within. This is a personal project. I dont expect others to use it.

_Sometimes I fell a bit burned out from genshin so if the data is not up-to-date. It is one of those moments or I just forgot to upload it to github :p_

## Application

Here are some images of the app.<br>

## Known issues

Currently the whole app re-renders when the user saves. I intend to change this in the future but because it is a core functionality of the app it will take a lot of time.

There should be some not translated string in the app.

The save is written to a json file, so better keep that file save somewhere.

## How to install

You can just download the [ZIP](data/Release.zip) file, extract the content, and run `tracker.exe`<br>
Because the dynamic backgrounds are too large for the upload, I had to remove the animation manually. If you want you can download and replace them in the assets folder.

## Disclaimer

The player widget in the main page uses the [Enka](https://github.com/yuko1101/enka-network-api) public api.

All images in this repository are extracted from the [Fandom](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki) website.<br>
Some backgrounds are from the [Hoyolab](https://wiki.hoyolab.com/pc/genshin/aggregate/character) official website, so I can have some dynamic background.

_As I said, this is just a personal project which I don't intent to make any profit from._
